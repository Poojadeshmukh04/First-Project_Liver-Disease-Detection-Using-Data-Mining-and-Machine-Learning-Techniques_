# First-Project_Liver-Disease-Detection-Using-Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning-Techniques_
This project uses data mining and ML to enhance liver disease detection. Analyzing clinical markers like bilirubin and enzymes from the ILPD dataset , I compared six models. Random Forest proved most accurate at 72.57% , offering a non-invasive tool for early diagnosis and better patient care.
